- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Floriannnvg
- I study Industrial Design at the University of Technology in Eindhoven. I'm currently working on a webserver that controls led strips from a raspberry pi, but since I probably won't update this anytime soon, you can assume this is outdated. 
- If you have questions, just send me an email at mail@florian.click
